**Design Movement**: Neumorphism / Soft UI (Modernized)
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Softness & Depth**: Use subtle shadows and highlights to create elements that appear to be extruded from the background.
2.  **Minimalist Clarity**: Focus on data visualization with minimal distractions, using whitespace to separate sections.
3.  **Tactile Interaction**: Buttons and cards should feel pressable and responsive.
4.  **Calm & Focused**: A soothing color palette to reduce cognitive load for administrators analyzing data.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: Off-white or very light gray (e.g., `#F0F2F5`) to serve as a neutral canvas.
*   **Primary**: Soft Blue (e.g., `#4A90E2`) for trust, intelligence, and communication.
*   **Accent**: Coral or Soft Orange (e.g., `#FF8C69`) for highlighting critical alerts or peak times.
*   **Text**: Dark Gray (e.g., `#333333`) for readability without the harshness of pure black.
*   **Reasoning**: This palette promotes a sense of calm and control, essential for data analysis.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Dashboard Grid**: A flexible, card-based grid layout where each metric lives in its own "soft" container.
*   **Asymmetric Balance**: Use a sidebar for navigation but allow the main content area to flow organically based on data hierarchy.
*   **Floating Elements**: Key stats or filters might "float" above the main dashboard layer.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Soft Cards**: Containers with double shadows (light top-left, dark bottom-right) to create the neumorphic effect.
2.  **Rounded Corners**: Generous border radius (e.g., `20px`) to reinforce the soft, friendly aesthetic.
3.  **Subtle Gradients**: Very faint gradients on backgrounds to add depth without being overwhelming.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Press & Release**: Buttons should visually depress when clicked.
*   **Hover Lift**: Cards should slightly lift or glow when hovered to indicate interactivity.
*   **Smooth Transitions**: All data updates and page navigations should be fluid and gentle.

**Animation**:
*   **Ease-in-out**: All movements should be natural and smooth.
*   **Pulse**: Critical alerts or live data points could have a gentle pulse animation.
*   **Fade & Slide**: Content should fade in and slide up slightly when loading.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: `Nunito` or `Quicksand` (Rounded Sans-serif) - Friendly, modern, and legible.
*   **Body**: `Roboto` or `Open Sans` - Clean, neutral, and highly readable for data labels and text.
*   **Hierarchy**: Bold weights for key metrics, lighter weights for labels.

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk / High-Tech HUD
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Data Density**: Display a high volume of information in a structured, organized manner, mimicking a futuristic control panel.
2.  **High Contrast**: Dark backgrounds with neon accents to make data pop and create a sense of urgency/importance.
3.  **Technical Precision**: Use monospaced fonts, grid lines, and technical markers to emphasize accuracy.
4.  **Immersive Experience**: The user should feel like they are piloting a sophisticated system.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: Deep Navy or Black (e.g., `#0B0C10`) for the background.
*   **Primary**: Neon Cyan (e.g., `#45A29E`) for primary data streams and positive indicators.
*   **Accent**: Electric Purple (e.g., `#C5C6C7`) or Hot Pink for alerts and anomalies.
*   **Text**: White or Light Gray for maximum contrast against the dark background.
*   **Reasoning**: Evokes a feeling of advanced technology and real-time monitoring.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Modular Grid**: Strictly aligned grid system with visible dividers or "scan lines".
*   **Fixed Sidebar/Header**: Persistent navigation and status indicators that frame the main viewport.
*   **Overlay Panels**: Detailed data or filters slide in as semi-transparent overlays.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Glowing Borders**: Elements have a faint glow to simulate screen luminescence.
2.  **Tech Markers**: Decorative corner brackets, crosshairs, and ruler lines.
3.  **Glitch Effects**: Subtle visual glitches on hover or load to reinforce the digital theme (used sparingly).

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Instant Feedback**: Interactions should feel snappy and immediate.
*   **Sound Effects (Optional)**: Subtle beeps or clicks on interaction (if appropriate for web).
*   **Focus States**: Highlighting active elements with brighter glows or border changes.

**Animation**:
*   **Typewriter Effect**: Text loading in character by character.
*   **Scan Lines**: A subtle vertical scan line moving across charts.
*   **Snap Transitions**: Elements snap into place rather than floating.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: `Orbitron` or `Rajdhani` (Tech/Sci-Fi Display) - Futuristic and bold.
*   **Body**: `Fira Code` or `JetBrains Mono` (Monospaced) - For data values and labels, enhancing the technical feel.
*   **Hierarchy**: Uppercase for labels, large numerals for data.

**Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Digital Adaptation)
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Grid Systems**: Rigorous adherence to a mathematical grid for alignment and organization.
2.  **Objective Photography/Imagery**: Use of clean, high-quality images or abstract geometric shapes.
3.  **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography used as a primary design element.
4.  **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetrical layouts that create visual interest while maintaining balance.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Base**: White or very light warm gray (e.g., `#F9F9F9`).
*   **Primary**: Swiss Red (e.g., `#DA291C`) - Bold, energetic, and classic.
*   **Secondary**: Black (e.g., `#000000`) - For strong contrast and typography.
*   **Accent**: Cobalt Blue or Emerald Green - Used sparingly for data differentiation.
*   **Reasoning**: Communicates clarity, objectivity, and timeless professionalism.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Modular Grid**: A strict grid that governs the placement of all elements.
*   **Whitespace**: Generous use of negative space to let the content breathe.
*   **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight of text define the structure more than boxes or borders.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Bold Rules**: Thick black or red lines to separate sections.
2.  **Large Typography**: Oversized headings that break the grid or span multiple columns.
3.  **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles, squares, and triangles used for icons or data points.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Clean & Direct**: Interactions are straightforward and functional.
*   **Hover Reveals**: Additional information is revealed on hover without cluttering the initial view.
*   **Scroll-Triggered**: Elements might slide or fade in based on scroll position.

**Animation**:
*   **Parallax**: Subtle parallax effects on images or large text.
*   **Slide-In**: Elements slide in from the sides or bottom, adhering to the grid lines.
*   **Staggered Reveal**: Content loads in a staggered sequence.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: `Helvetica Now` or `Inter` (Neo-Grotesque) - The quintessential Swiss font. Tight tracking, bold weights.
*   **Body**: `Helvetica Now` or `Inter` - Regular weight, comfortable line height.
*   **Hierarchy**: Extreme contrast in size between headings and body text.
