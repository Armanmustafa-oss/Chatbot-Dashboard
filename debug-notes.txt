Chart Debug Notes:
1. Message Volume Trend - completely blank (no area chart visible)
2. Sentiment Analysis - shows 0% POSITIVE, no pie chart
3. Peak Messaging Times - not visible in screenshot (need to scroll)

The KPI cards show data:
- Total Messages: 3952
- Avg Response Time: 1.8 seconds
- Satisfaction Score: 0%
- Est. Cost Saved: $8,233

Issue: The charts are not rendering despite data being available in the database.
The dailyAnalytics data is likely not being returned correctly from the API.

Need to check:
1. The getDailyData function in server/db.ts
2. The analytics router in server/routers.ts
3. The data transformation in Home.tsx
