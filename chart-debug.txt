Chart Debug Analysis:

Database Status:
- dailyAnalytics: 31 rows
- hourlyPeakTimes: 744 rows  
- queryCategories: 10 rows

Issue: Charts are still blank despite data existing in database.

Possible causes:
1. The date range filter might not match the dates in the database
2. The API queries might be returning empty arrays
3. The chart components might have rendering issues with the data format

Next steps:
1. Check the date range being sent to the API
2. Verify the API is returning data
3. Add console logging to debug the data flow
4. Ensure chart colors are visible against the background
