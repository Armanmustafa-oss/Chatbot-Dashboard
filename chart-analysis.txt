Chart Analysis - December 7, 2025

ISSUE: All three charts (Message Volume Trend, Sentiment Analysis, Peak Messaging Times) are BLANK.

OBSERVATIONS FROM SCREENSHOT:
1. Message Volume Trend - completely empty, no line/area chart visible
2. Sentiment Analysis - shows "0% POSITIVE" and all sentiment bars show 0%
3. Peak Messaging Times - completely empty, no bar chart visible
4. Top Student Queries - shows data (456, 445, 444, 441, 440 queries)
5. KPI cards show data: 3952 total messages, 1.8 seconds response time, $8,233 cost saved

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- The KPI data IS loading (3952 messages, 1.8s response time)
- The Top Queries data IS loading (456 queries etc.)
- But the dailyAnalytics and hourlyPeakTimes data is NOT loading properly
- The sentiment shows 0% because kpiData.positiveCount, neutralCount, negativeCount are all 0 or null

SOLUTION NEEDED:
1. Check if dailyAnalytics table has data with correct date format
2. Check if hourlyPeakTimes table has data
3. Ensure the date range query is matching the data in the database
4. The charts use fallback sample data if no data - but even that's not showing

The issue is likely that:
- Either the database tables are empty
- Or the date format doesn't match the query
- Or the chart components aren't rendering properly
