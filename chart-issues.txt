Chart Issues Identified:

1. Message Volume Trend - Chart is completely blank/empty, no data visible
2. Sentiment Analysis - Shows 64% POSITIVE but the pie chart itself is not visible, only the center text. The breakdown shows Positive: 0%, Neutral: 0%, Negative: 0%
3. Peak Messaging Times - Chart is completely blank/empty, no bars visible

Root Cause Analysis:
- The charts are rendering but the data visualization elements (bars, areas, pie slices) are not visible
- This could be due to:
  a) Chart colors matching the background
  b) Data not being properly passed to the chart components
  c) ResponsiveContainer not properly sizing
  d) The sentiment breakdown shows 0% for all categories despite showing 64% positive in the center

Fix Strategy:
- Add explicit, high-contrast colors for all chart elements
- Ensure data is properly formatted before passing to charts
- Add minimum height to chart containers
- Debug the sentiment data calculation
